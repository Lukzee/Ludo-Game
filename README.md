## Rules of the Game

- The token (goti) moves out from the house when the dice indicates 6.
- Whenever a player gets a six, they get an additional chance.
- Stops exist where tokens won't attack opponent's tokens, although these stops haven't been added yet.
- The game can be played among 4 players.
- The player who secures all 4 tokens by reaching the center (the win area) of the board wins the game.

## To Play the Game

1. Click on the square dice to roll it.
2. By default, the red player moves first.
3. Click on the red token to move it according to the number indicated on the dice.
4. If the dice indicates 1 or 6, the token can be taken out of the house.
5. Unlock the dice by clicking on the tokens of the correct color.
6. Turns move in a clockwise fashion starting from red.
